## Ever wondered what entities are actually loaded in your game or modpack?
**Entity Exporter** utility is a lightweight tool that gives you instant access to every entity registered by Minecraft â€“ vanilla and modded alike.

With a single command, you can:
- âœ… Print entities directly in chat
- âœ… Export them into clean, structured .json files
- âœ… View them by category: 
    > - all (separated by groups)
    > -  hostile
    > - creature 
  > - groups

Perfect for modpack creators, developers and testers who need a quick way to check whatâ€™s in the registry without digging through configs or code.
***
### Mod adds 8 commands into the game:

```
/entitylist groups - Prints in chat all the entity groups registered.
/entitylist all export - Export entities to JSON file
/entitylist all print - Print all entities in chat
/entitylist hostile export  - Export hostiles to JSON file
/entitylist hostile print - Print all hostile entities in chat
/entitylist creature export - Export all creatures to JSON file
/entitylist creature print - Print all creature entities in chat
/entitylist help - Prints all these commands.
```
### ðŸ“‚ Export Location

```
C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft\[instance]\Entity_list
```
### Following the pattern in alfabetical order:
```
[modid]:[entity]
```

And each export command creates new `.JSON` file unless it already exists.
***
### âš¡ SIMPLE. FAST. HASSLE-FREE.

_Entity Exporter doesnâ€™t change entities â€“ it just makes them visible, so you can always know whatâ€™s registered in your game._
